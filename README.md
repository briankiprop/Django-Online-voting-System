# Django-Online-voting-System
This is an online voting system source code developed using django
I used boostrap for css and other enhancements
You can always add other features.

The user can register and login but candidates for respective are added to the database directly by the admin. the register page is not neccessary depending on the situation. For example an Institution need to register students rather than letting the register themselves to ensure no multiple accounts created.
In that case user can remove the Register function
